PE01 â€“ Hello World


# Input
This React Native app does not require user input. It runs automatically and displays hardcoded text including my name, degree program, and school.

# Process
The app is created using Expo and runs inside GitHub Codespaces. It uses one View component as the layout container, three Text components to display each message, and a StyleSheet to style them. The background is set to yellow as required. All text is centered on the screen.

# Output
When the app runs, the output is a yellow screen with three lines of text: my name, my degree program, and my school. The information is displayed clearly and is easy to read on both Android and iOS simulators.
